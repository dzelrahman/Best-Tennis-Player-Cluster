# Best-Tennis-Player-Cluster
The data is structured by each row containing one match, including match info, along with winning and losing playerâ€™s statistics. The goal of this project is to explore how top tennis players group together based on their statistics, particularly in the matches that have best of 5 format, using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means clustering analysis. In addition, I also explore how clusters of players differ by surface (hard, clay, and grass).
